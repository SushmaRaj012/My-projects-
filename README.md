## Dataset:

## Data Analysis using DAX Measures:

## A Measure was created to find the Total Revenue generated after the promotion

Revenue_After_Promo = SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(after_promo)])* SUM(fact_events[base_price])

## A Measure was created to find the Total Revenue generated before the promotion

Revenue_Before_Promo = SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(before_promo)])* SUM(fact_events[base_price])

## A Measure is created to find the Total Revenue generated (before and after the promotion)

Total_Revenue = [Rev_After_Promo]+[Rev_Before_Promo]

## A Measure is created to find the no of Total units sold all togother

Tot_Units_Sold = SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(before_promo)])+ SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(after_promo)])

## A Measure is created to find out the increased amount revenue after promotion and the increased percentage
Increased_Revenue = [Rev_After_Promo]-[Rev_Before_Promo]

Increased_Revenue% = DIVIDE([Rev_After_Promo]-[Rev_Before_Promo], [Rev_Before_Promo],0)*100

## A Measure is created to find out the increased units sold after promotion and the increased percentage
Increased_Sold_Units = SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(after_promo)]) - SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(before_promo)])

Increased_sold_unit% = VAR PREV = SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(before_promo)])
RETURN DIVIDE([ISU], PREV,0)

## A Measure is created to find out the promotional revenue contribution ratio over the total Revenue 
Promotion_Penetration_Rate = DIVIDE([Rev_After_Promo], [Total_Rev], 0)


## A Measure is created to find out what is the growth in average item per transaction
Growth_in_Avg_Item_per_Transaction = 
 var Avg_Quantity_Sold_After_Promo = DIVIDE(SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(after_promo)]), COUNT(fact_events[event_id]))
 var Avg_Quantity_Sold_Before_Promo = DIVIDE(SUM(fact_events[quantity_sold(before_promo)]),COUNT(fact_events[event_id]))
RETURN
DIVIDE(Avg_Quantity_Sold_After_Promo - Avg_Quantity_Sold_Before_Promo, Avg_Quantity_Sold_Before_Promo, 0)

 ###  Produce a report that calculates the Incremental Sold Quantity (ISU%) for each category during the Diwali campaign. Additionally, provide rankings for the categories based on their ISU%. 

 WITH CTE AS 
(SELECT F.event_id, F.store_id, F.campaign_id, F.product_code,            F.quantity_sold_before_promo,      F.quantity_sold_after_promo, C.campaign_name,            P.product_name, P.category

(SELECT product_name, category,         ((quantity_sold_after_promo - quantity_sold_before_promo) / quantity_sold_before_promo) * 100 AS IR_PERC,            campaign_name    FROM CTE) AS SUB_QUERY
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY Max_ISU_PERC DESC;

 ### Create a report featuring the Top 5 products, ranked by Incremental Revenue Percentage (IR%), across all campaigns. 

WITH CTE AS  
(SELECT F.product_code,   P.product_name, P.category, SUM(F.quantity_sold_before_promo * F.base_price) AS Rev_before_promo,

Executive Summary

BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) has generated the highest incremental revenue across multiple product categories. customers are highly responsive to this offer. This promotion should be heavily marketed for high-selling items.

The 500 Cashback promotion also resulted in significant revenue growth, particularly for high-value product combos

Promotions like 25% OFF were ineffective. Customers may not find these discounts substantial enough to drive action. We can reduce smaller discount offers like 25% OFF and focus on higher percentage discounts or different. For smaller promotions, consider other value-adds like loyalty points or bundling with high-performing items to stimulate demand without excessive discounting, which can also maintain margins without over-discounting.

Gathering feedback on how customers perceive promotions could further clarify why some promotions work better than others.

Ensure that promotions are targeted to the appropriate audience for each product and category.

Apply the successful elements of the Sankranti campaign to future promotions, especially for high-traffic sales periods like Diwali, to achieve higher revenue gains.
